NAME

  Strict::Perl - Perl module to restrict old/unsafe constructs

SYNOPSIS

  use Strict::Perl 2019.07; # must version, must match

DESCRIPTION

  Strict::Perl provides a restricted scripting environment excluding old/unsafe
  constructs, on both modern Perl and traditional Perl.

  Strict::Perl works in concert with Modern::Open and Fake::Our if those are used
  in your script.

  Version specify is required when use Strict::Perl, like;

    use Strict::Perl 2019.07;

  It's die if specified version doesn't match Strict::Perl's version.

  On Perl 5.010001 or later, Strict::Perl works as;

    use strict;
    use warnings qw(FATAL all);
    use Fatal # by compatible routine in Strict::Perl
    qw(
        seek sysseek
        dbmclose dbmopen
        binmode close chmod chown fcntl flock ioctl open sysopen truncate
        chdir closedir opendir link mkdir readlink rename rmdir symlink
        pipe
        msgctl msgget msgrcv msgsnd
        semctl semget semop
        shmctl shmget shmread
        accept bind connect getsockopt listen recv send setsockopt shutdown socketpair
        fork
    );
    use autodie qw(
        read sysread syswrite
        fileno
    );
